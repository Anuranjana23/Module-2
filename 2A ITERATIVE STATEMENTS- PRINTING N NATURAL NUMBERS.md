## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS – PRINTING N NATURAL NUMBERS

###  Aim
To create a Python program for printing `n` natural numbers using a `for` loop.

---

###  Algorithm

1. Begin the program.
2. Use `input()` to read the value of `n` (the upper limit) from the user.
3. Convert the input to an integer.
4. Display the message **"Natural Numbers are :"**.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
6. In each iteration, print the current value of `i`.
7. Terminate the program.

### 🧾 Program

```python
#Reg.NO 212222050039
#Name Navee P

### PROGRAM
```
n=int(input())
print("Natural Numbers are :")
for i in range(1,n+1,1):
    print(i)
```

```
### OUTPUT
